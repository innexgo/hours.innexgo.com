# Innexgo Hours
Innexgo Hours is a web-based office hours/tutorial appointment system that is currently in development. Our product streamlines tutorial/office hours by allowing students to 
request appointments with their teachers and gives teachers the final say in who gets what time slots, because they know which students require more help.

Innexgo Hours benefits all individuals in schools:

<li><b>Students</b> can request tutorial sessions with teachers. They can see all their approved tutorials on one screen and can schedule their homework and studies around their 
allocated tutorial sessions.</li>
<br>
<li><b>Teachers</b> can see who has requested tutorial sessions, and then allocate time slots for them. Teachers can also request reports on how frequently and how much time 
students are spending with them. This can be a helpful report during parent-teacher conferences.</li>
<br>
<li><b>Administrators</b> can request reports on student attendance during tutorials. Administrators can also obtain reports on teacher time spent on tutorials to see if teachers 
need help to handle all students.</li>
